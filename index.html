       <h2>Passion Projects</h2>
   </div>
         <p>

A few projects of mine include...
            
<li>Sonic Replayable (ON HOLD) - A ROM Hack of Sonic 1 that's meant to be an "Encore Mode" similar to Sonic Mania Plus, so expect some cool twists to the level design! The page for it can be seen <a href="https://gamejolt.com/games/sonic_the_replayable/791581"target="_blank"> here.</a></li>

   <img src="images/LabyrinthZone.png" alt="Gameplay screenshot of Sonic running through a Labyrinth with a different palette." style="width: 460px; height: 350px;"> 

            <br>
            
<li>CD-Sonic Beyond (ON HOLD) - This is essentially a Sonic fangame that aims to be a complete version of v0.02, a very early Sonic CD prototype built one year before its release (1992). Image used is a mockup made for the project. </li> 

<img src="images/CollisionChaos.png" alt="Mockup image of what I think the Sonic CD project would look like. The colors chosen for the environment were originally for the Bad Future of Collision Chaos." style="width:500px;height:350px;"> <br>

<li>Vs. Susie (IN PROGRESS) - Experience the Friday Night Funkin' mod that takes place in a world where reality meets fiction. More information can be found <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@SFunkinST/"> through its YouTube channel.</a></li>
